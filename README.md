# 🦟 Malaria Transmission Model – Madagascar

This repository contains a **deterministic malaria transmission model** that simulates the interaction between humans and mosquito vectors under varying **Insecticide-Treated Net (ITN)** coverage and resistance conditions.  

The model combines a **Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR)** framework for the human population with a **Susceptible–Infected (SI)** framework for the mosquito population, implemented using **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** solved in **R**.

## 📘 Model Overview

### Mathematical Framework
- **Humans:** ( Sₕ → Iₕ → Rₕ )  
- **Mosquitoes:** ( Sᵥ → Iᵥ )  
- The model dynamically adjusts mosquito–human transmission rates based on **ITN efficacy decay**, reflecting the buildup of **insecticide resistance** over time.
