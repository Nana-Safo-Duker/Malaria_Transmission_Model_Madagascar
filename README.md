# 🦟 Malaria Transmission Model in Madagascar

This repository contains the R-based simulation and fitting of a **malaria transmission model** that combines an SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) framework for the human population and an SI (Susceptible–Infected) framework for the mosquito population. 

The model incorporates **Insecticide-Treated Net (ITN)** effectiveness that decays over time to simulate growing insecticide resistance a key public health challenge in malaria control.
